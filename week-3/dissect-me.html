        <h1>Week 1: Version Control</h1>
      </header>
      <div><p>There's been a lot to cover in the past couple of weeks... computer systems setup, introductions, Google Hangouts, and now we're diving a little into version control and a bit of code! So many interesting topics to cover but I've been doing my best try not to go on too long about each aspect of the git commands and all the functions on the command line in my reflections. Overall, it's been a lot to take in - at least for someone coming from a non-tech background. I'm currently working in the translation industry and though I'm passionate about foreign languages and love my job, after trying out programming I've just been hooked and so intrigued by what you can create once you develp a foundation.</p>
​
      <p>As we're just a week or so in, I'm clearly still developing this foundation, but it's been quite interesting what I've learned so far! There's been walk-through videos, hands-on practice, and a great community to reach out to if there's ever any questions. Although I've gone over some of these commands before, most of the material is new, so it takes a bit of time before fully understanding the concepet. Luckily, there's been plenty of readings to cover and explain the material in more than one way, and after a bit of practice during the assignments it's starting to all sink in.</p>

<!--
##What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

While using all the basic ones such pas <p> and <h1> as they are the basic building blocks for text, I found us using the <section> tag again and again. I think it is simply a useful basic building block for a page, allowing you to section off content in a generic and clean manner. It is great for organizing.


##How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Elements get laid out on a page in a heirarchical and nested structure. The browser displays these elements first in a top down manner, each nested element being dictated and organized to the limits of its parent elements.


##What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I learned about snippets, which I think will be very useful in the future when more complex projects are in play. A snippet with a full html page, with js links, scripts, etc. would be very useful. I will research more as we go along to increase efficieny, I know shortcuts to highlight all the instances of a certain variable or function in a document would be very helpful.
