## What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?

It is important to make sure your path is correct. Good practice is to have images and stylesheets in their own directory, so you have to ensure that the path is correct, relative to where the file you are linking from is in the directory structure.


## What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?

We used mostly semantic HTML5 elements when possible and then adjusted centering with CSS. We also used the line-height property in various sections to get the differet lines of text in a section closer together as they are on the real site.


## What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)

Not sure I understand the question. We used font-size to adjust various sizes. We also used a new property font-variant: small-caps; to create the look of the header without using spans.


## Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?

We created two classes .section-1 to adjust the layout of the first "footer" and also .small-text to adjust the smaller text found in the list items and the footer.


## When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?

Our site that we created was definitely better practices than the real site. The actual Berkshire site is all inline html which is unmaintainable and totally unscaleable.
