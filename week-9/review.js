// Create Accountability groups from a list of students.

// PSEUDOCOD
// Input: An array of names
// Output: An object of Randomized Accountability Groups
// Steps:
// -Create a function that takes in an array of names.
// -Shuffle the array
// -Find the length of the array to decide how many groups are needed
// -Create an object constructor that takes in a number and creates an object with group names as pairs.
// Loop through and assign people in the array to groups until array is empty.
// Create a list function that logs out the group names in a list


// Initial solution

// Add shuffle to array Protype
Array.prototype.shuffle = function() {
    var input = this;

    for (var i = input.length-1; i >=0; i--) {

        var randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random()*(i+1));
        var itemAtIndex = input[randomIndex];

        input[randomIndex] = input[i];
        input[i] = itemAtIndex;
    }
    return input;
}

// Begin solution

// Create groups based on a list of names and the object to create groups into

function grouper(names, groups) {
  // Find number of groups needed in whole number
  var num_groups = Math.floor(names.length/4);

  // Create group keys with empty arrays in passed in object according to num_groups
  for (var i = 1; i <= num_groups; i++) {
    groups["Group " + i] =  []
  };

  // Create shuffled array of names to pick from
  var students = names.shuffle();

  // Pull from students and assign to groups in sequence
  while (students.length > 0) {
    for (group in groups) {

      // Pull a name from randomized students list
      var student_name = students.pop()

      // Check to see if undefined to prevent adding empty array elements, then add to group arrays in object.
      if (typeof student_name != 'undefined')
      groups[group].push(student_name);
    };
  }

}

// Lists out groups
function listGroups(object) {
  for (group in object) {
    console.log( group + ": " + object[group].join(', '))
  }
}

// REFLECT

// What concepts did you solidify in working on this challenge?
// I solidified creating and accessing key value pairs in objects.

// What was the most difficult part of this challenge?
// Nothing was too challenging. I tried using .splice to pull random elements from an array, but it was giving me strange results, so instead I just randomized the array first and then just used pop to get elements.


// Did you solve the problem in a new way this time?
// Yes, and I think this way is better. Formerly I just sliced up an array. This time I created an object of accounabilty groups and based on how many were names are in the list to make sure groups had around 4 people, then populated them with names from the array in a ranodomized manner.

// Was your pseudocode different from the Ruby version? What was the same and what was different?
// It was different because I attacked the problem differently.âˆ«
