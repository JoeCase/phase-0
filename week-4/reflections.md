###What does it mean to iterate over an array?
To iterate over an array means to evaluate and/ or peform an action over each element contained in an array. It basically means to look at each element in the array one by one.

###How are arrays structured? What can they contain?

Arrays are ordered and indexed collections of data. They have an order and each object of piece of data has a definitive place in that order. Arrays can contain any kind of variable or object, whether that be a string, a number, boolean, another array or a hash.


###Based on what you've learned, what is the best way to access values in a hash?

The best way to access values in a hash is by referring to the key paired with that value. Hashes are arranged in key: value pairs where the key is usually a descriptive string (but can actually be any obect) describing what the value is referring to.


###What are some important things to remember about hash keys and uniqueness?

Hash keys must be unique within a hash becayse they are unordered. You cannot have two identical keys pointing to different values.


###What are the main differences between arrays and hashes? When do you think one will be better over the other?

Arrays have a distinct order so are best used when some kind of order is needed. Hashes have no order so are best used with collection of data that are random. Hashes seem to be best used for cases where values are paired with descriptive yet non ordered values.
