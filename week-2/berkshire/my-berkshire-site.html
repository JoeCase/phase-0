<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
    It was easy in that the site was simple. I did find it difficult to figure out what they used for some aspects, such as the date for updates.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
    It was intersting. I am used to using divs, and I don't know if two "asides" are the propper way to format it to me. Using them was easy enough, but I did worry a bit too much if I was using the "right" tags.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
    Good, but I definitley wanted to make it look prettier! I'm thinking about calling up Mr. Buffet and offering my expertise.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
    HTML is great for content, terrible for presentation. It provides a good framework to contain the data.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
    No real tricks yet.
