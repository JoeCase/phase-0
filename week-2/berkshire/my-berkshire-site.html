<!--
 - What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  It was fun to turn the learned html into a new site that you can actually see. It give that feeling of power! Though simple and basic you can see how good practices can be important when sites get complex and large.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  It was good. I was familiar with some of them before but its great to know how to set  clear and understandable markup structure.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  I did pretty good. I know CSS will unlock a lot of the styling capabilities, but I kept the html pretty clean and structural only for the most part.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
  It’s good how basic it is and how most of its power resides in the simplest of structural tags. I don’t know whats bad about it. You could complain that it is limited in its functionality, but I actually think that is what is powerful about it.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  I don’t know about any tricks. Good to have a cheat sheet nearby, but I know the chest sheet will quickly get absorbed and writing it will be second nature. Always close those tags and use good indenting to keep things clear.
