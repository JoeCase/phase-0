### What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

The primary goal of my site is to showcase who I am and the development work that I have done. The site will feature projects that I have worked on and built as well as personal information about myself.


### What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site adressing them?

My primary audience's interests would be to see the work that I have previously done and gather information about me and my talents. The site would address these needs by being designed in a very clear and minimal way. The user would be able to to the porfolio projects very clearly and quickly.


### What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

The primary action will be to see my portfolio. This can be combined with contacting me by placing contact information on the front page or in the header/ navigation. I think you should be able to address two "primary" needs at all times.


### What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

The main things people should know is that design doesn't just refer to how something looks. Design is inherently how something functions and encompasses many things that go beyond mere aesthetic choices. When designing, you should always be designing for a purpose, for an intended outcome. That takes research, thinking and planning many steps before you begin coding.


### What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

User experience is the craft of design and contructing the overall experience of how a web product or site feels to use. It encompasses many different things like psychology, visual design, research, empathy, etc. It is valuable because it increases the effectiveness of sites and products. It makes them more usable and more pleasurable to use, thus more effective.


### Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

The site map was simple but a bit tedious. It is a necessary step certainly, but seemed only tedious thing.
