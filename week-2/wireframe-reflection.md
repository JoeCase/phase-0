###What is a wireframe?

A wireframe is a very basic design of how a page or app is laid out. It is not supposed to have little to no design decisions in it other than layout.


###Whata are the benefits of wireframing?
Wireframing allows you to decide how a page is laid out before you start to code. It allows you to quickly and roughly try get ideas down on how something will be arranged. The benefits are that you can see what isn't working before you commit time to coding.


###Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

Yes I did enjoy the wireframing. I enjoy designing things.


###Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I stuck to my first idea. I made it very minimal and clean.


###What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I didn't ask any questions really. I have wireframed before so it was a familiar process. I would love to check out Balsamiq more as it seems like a great tool.


###Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I enjoyed the actually designing. I didn't find any of it to be tedious really. It was fun to wireframe both. My blog wireframe was simply the nav bar from my main page, as I think it is best to have just that. I might add more elements to it later.
